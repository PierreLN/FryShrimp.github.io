          <p>
            Disclosure: If you are currently happy with your current frame and
            not constantly complaining about your situation, then keep doing
            what you are doing. It's all about achieving this peace of mind.

          <p>
            Everyday, you make a decision. Whether you passively maintain your
            current state or take a step closer to the stronger version of
            yourself, you made a decision and will keep making decision
            consciously or unconsciously.
          </p>
          <p>The first step to a successful life is awareness.</p>
          <p>
            <em>"Your reality is what you believe."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people, because of the lifestyle they chose are massively
            restrained to what they can do. Because of where they are born,
            responsibility, society expectations, decision, fear, laziness, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I am lucky. I can be whoever I want to be. I can do whatever I
            want to do. Go where I want to go. Because of my personality,
            because I consciously choose who I am, I can do things that other
            people can't do or can't allow themselves to do.
          </p>
          <p>And this is powerful. This is a position of freedom.</p>
          <p>
            Move out from your old frame and allow yourself to decide more for
            yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can do it too, if you really desire it at the bottom of your
            heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just focus on a few keys things, balance your life. It's better to
            be slow but confident than very fast but fragile.

          <h3>Different ways to break the frame:</h3>
          <p>
            The idea here is creating a distance from your current frame.
            Disconnect from the "current you". Distance from your thoughts,
            to-do list, people around you, social media, external influence,
            stress, etc. Creating some space to connect with your soul. Ask
            yourself the question you have been holding and take the time to
            answer them.
